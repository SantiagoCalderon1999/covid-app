# Getting Started with Create React App

This repo contains the source code of a webpage that obtains information from the Covid19API and shows the results. Furthermore, this frontend can receive information about the symptoms that are being experienced by the users of the application.

## Built with:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Coronavirus Covid19 API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest#6fbc46d6-0ddf-400b-a743-a149e9bba381)

## Production

You can check the webpage deployed in the following [link](https://joyful-snickerdoodle-ac2918.netlify.app/). This frontend application was deployed to the free service Netlify.

## How to run locally?

1. Clone the repo locally with the following command:
```
git@github.com:SantiagoCalderon1999/covid-app.git
```

2. Use this command to install all the dependencies from the application.
```
npm install
```

3. You should have a KENDO_UI_LICENSE, which you can get for a free-trial period in this [link](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/my-license/).

Once you have your own key, run the following command and replace the "xxxxx" with your own key.
```
KENDO_UI_LICENSE=xxxxx npm start
```
